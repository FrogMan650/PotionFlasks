Potion Flasks hold multiple doses of a single type of potion. For instance, a Medium Flask can hold up to 5 doses of enhanced speed potion, but can not hold a dose of speed potion and jump boost potion at the same time.

This mod adds 4 new items to the game: Small Flask, Medium Flask, Large Flask, and Hoglin Leather. Hoglin Leather is used to craft Large Flasks and as you might guess is dropped by Hoglins at a 1/10 rate.

The Small Flask can hold 2 doses, the Medium Flask can hold 5 doses, and the Large Flask can hold 10 doses. They can be filled with any normal potion, not Splash or Lingering. Theoretically they *should* work with modded potions as well, but I haven't tested this.

Doses are added to the Flask by having an already brewed potion in your inventory and using the Flask in either the main or off hand. It will search the inventory from left to right starting with the hotbar and then moving on to the top left corner of the inventory. If using an empty Flask, the first potion it finds will be added to the flask, which can then later be consumed like a regular potion to get it's effect. If using an already partially charged Flask it doesn't matter where or in what order potions are in the inventory, it only searches for potions of the same exact type and adds their doses.

Once the Flask is empty it can be assigned to a new type of potion again using the above method. They can be emptied of all doses by using it on a cauldron with any water level.

To craft them you'll need to upgrade from Small to Medium to Large. Crafting book recipes are unlocked by creating the previous, and the Small Flask recipe is unlocked by obtaining a Glass Bottle.
